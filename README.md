# Ownership-GraphBuilder
Ownership Graph Builder — Developed a Python tool that models and visualizes company ownership structures as directed graphs. The tool consumes JSON ownership records (e.g., “Company A owns 60% of Company B”) and generates clear, annotated network graphs showing parent companies, subsidiaries, and control percentages.
